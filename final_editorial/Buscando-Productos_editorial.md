# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to find the location of a product in a warehouse. Each product has a unique label, represented by an integer. The products are arranged in ascending order of their labels. We are given a list of labels and we need to find the position of each label in the list. If a label is not in the list, we should return -1.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is recognizing that we can use a data structure to store the positions of the labels in the list. Since the labels are unique, a map would be an ideal choice. The map would store the labels as keys and their positions as values. This way, we can quickly look up the position of a label in constant time.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. First, we read the number of products, `N`, from the input.
2. We create a map, `m`, to store the labels and their positions.
3. We read the labels from the input, one by one. For each label, we add it to the map with its position.
4. Next, we read the number of queries, `R`, from the input.
5. For each query, we read the label from the input and look it up in the map.
6. If the label is in the map, we print its position. Otherwise, we print -1.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N) for reading the labels and O(R) for processing the queries, so the overall time complexity is O(N + R). The space complexity is O(N) for storing the labels and their positions in the map.

# Implementation Details
The tricky part of this implementation is handling the case where a label is not in the map. In C++, if we try to access a key that is not in the map, the map will automatically create a default value for that key. In this case, the default value is 0. So, if the position of a label is 0, that means the label is not in the map.

# Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include<map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create a map to store the labels and their positions
    map<int,int> m;

    // Read the number of products
    int N;
    cin >> N;

    // Read the labels and add them to the map
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        int a;
        cin >> a;
        m[a] = i;
    }

    // Read the number of queries
    cin >> N;

    // Process the queries
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        int a;
        cin >> a;

        // If the label is in the map, print its position
        // Otherwise, print -1
        if (m[a] == 0) {
            cout << "-1\n";
        } else {
            cout << m[a] << "\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This code first creates a map to store the labels and their positions. It then reads the labels from the input and adds them to the map. After that, it reads the number of queries and processes each query by looking up the label in the map and printing its position. If the label is not in the map, it prints -1.
