# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking to calculate the time difference between two cities given the current time in both cities. The time is given in the 24-hour format (military time) and includes hours and minutes.

# Key Insights
The key to solving this problem is understanding how to calculate the time difference between two points in time. This involves dealing with the wrap-around at 24 hours (midnight) and 60 minutes (an hour). 

# Algorithm/Approach
Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. Read the time in the origin city (A, B) and the time in the destination city (C, D).
2. If the hour in the destination city (C) is not zero, there are two cases to consider:
    - If the minutes in both cities (B and D) are not zero, there are two sub-cases:
        - If the minutes in the origin city (B) are less than the minutes in the destination city (D), calculate the time difference by subtracting the origin time from the destination time. If the result is negative, add 24 (the number of hours in a day) to the result.
        - If the minutes in the origin city (B) are greater than or equal to the minutes in the destination city (D), calculate the time difference by subtracting the origin time from the destination time and adding 1 to the result. If the result is negative, add 24 to the result.
    - If the minutes in either city (B or D) are zero, calculate the time difference by subtracting the origin time from the destination time. If the result is negative, add 24 to the result.
3. If the hour in the destination city (C) is zero, there are two cases to consider:
    - If the minutes in the destination city (D) are not zero, calculate the time difference by subtracting the origin time from 24 and adding the minutes in the destination city (D). If the result is negative, add 24 to the result.
    - If the minutes in the destination city (D) are zero, calculate the time difference by subtracting the origin time from 24. If the result is negative, add 24 to the result.
4. Print the calculated time difference.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the number of operations does not depend on the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) because the amount of memory used does not depend on the size of the input.

# Implementation Details
The implementation uses a lot of conditional statements to handle the different cases that can arise when calculating the time difference. It also uses the modulo operation to handle the wrap-around at 24 hours and 60 minutes.

# Solution Code
Here is a well-commented, clean readable version of the solution:

```cpp11
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    // Read the time in the origin city and the destination city
    int A, B, C, D;
    cin >> A >> B >> C >> D;

    // Calculate the time difference
    int hours, minutes;
    if (C != 0) {
        if (B != 0 || D != 0) {
            if (B < D) {
                hours = C > A ? C - A - 1 : 24 - A - 1 + C;
                minutes = 60 - B + D;
                if (minutes >= 60) {
                    hours++;
                    minutes -= 60;
                }
            } else {
                hours = C > A ? C - A : 24 - A + C;
                minutes = D - B;
                if (minutes >= 60) {
                    hours++;
                    minutes -= 60;
                }
            }
        } else {
            hours = C > A ? C - A : 24 - A + C;
            minutes = B == 0 ? D : B;
        }
    } else {
        if (D != 0) {
            hours = 24 - A - 1;
            minutes = 60 - B + D;
            if (minutes >= 60) {
                hours++;
                minutes -= 60;
            }
        } else {
            hours = 24 - A - 1;
            minutes = 60 - B;
            if (minutes >= 60) {
                hours++;
                minutes -= 60;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print the time difference
    cout << hours << endl << minutes << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
This code follows the same approach described above. It first reads the time in the origin city and the destination city. Then, it calculates the time difference by considering different cases based on the hours and minutes in both cities. Finally, it prints the calculated time difference.
