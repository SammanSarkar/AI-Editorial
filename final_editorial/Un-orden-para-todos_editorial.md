# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking to find a formation of students that would satisfy all the professors. Each professor has a different criterion for ordering the students and a tolerance level, which is the maximum number of positions a student can be away from their correct position according to that professor's criterion. If such a formation does not exist, we should return -1.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that it can be modeled as a maximum bipartite matching problem. Each student can be seen as a node in the first set of the bipartite graph, and each position can be seen as a node in the second set. An edge exists between a student and a position if the student can be in that position according to at least one professor's criterion.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Initialize an interval for each student from 0 to N-1. This interval represents the possible positions for each student.
2. For each professor, update the interval for each student according to the professor's criterion and tolerance level. The new interval for a student is the intersection of the current interval and the interval defined by the professor's criterion.
3. After processing all professors, find a maximum matching in the bipartite graph. If a maximum matching exists and covers all students, then a formation exists. Otherwise, a formation does not exist.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(N^2), where N is the number of students. This is because we need to iterate over all students and all positions to find a maximum matching. The space complexity is O(N), which is the space needed to store the intervals and the matching.

# Implementation Details
The implementation uses a depth-first search to find an augmenting path in the bipartite graph. The `aumenta` function tries to find an augmenting path starting from a student. If an augmenting path is found, the function updates the matching and returns true. The `acoplamiento` function finds a maximum matching by repeatedly finding augmenting paths.

# Solution Code
```cpp11
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

// This function tries to find an augmenting path starting from student i.
bool aumenta(int i, const std::pair<int, int>* intervalo, int* regreso, bool* visto, int n) {
   for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      if (intervalo[i].first <= j && j <= intervalo[i].second && !visto[j]) {
         visto[j] = true;
         if (regreso[j] == -1 || aumenta(regreso[j], intervalo, regreso, visto, n)) {
            regreso[j] = i;
            return true;
         }
      }
   }
   return false;
}

// This function finds a maximum matching in the bipartite graph.
int acoplamiento(const std::pair<int, int>* intervalo, int* regreso, int n) {
   std::fill(regreso, regreso + n, -1);
   for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      bool visto[n] = { };
      aumenta(i, intervalo, regreso, visto, n);
   }
   return n - std::count(regreso, regreso + n, -1);
}

int main( ) {
   int n, p, k;
   std::cin >> n >> p >> k;

   std::pair<int, int> intervalo[n];
   std::fill(intervalo, intervalo + n, std::make_pair(0, n - 1));
   for (int i = 0; i < p; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
         int actual;
         std::cin >> actual;
         intervalo[actual] = { std::max(intervalo[actual].first, j - k), std::min(intervalo[actual].second, j + k) };
      }
   }

   int regreso[n];
   if (acoplamiento(intervalo, regreso, n) == n) {
      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
         std::cout << regreso[i] << " ";
      }
   } else {
      std::cout << -1 << "\n";
   }
}
```
This solution code first reads the input and updates the intervals for each student. Then it finds a maximum matching in the bipartite graph. If a maximum matching that covers all students is found, it prints the matching. Otherwise, it prints -1.
