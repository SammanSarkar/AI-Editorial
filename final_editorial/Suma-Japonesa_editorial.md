# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to calculate the sum of `n` numbers modulo 100 and print the result in Japanese. We are given a function `int2Japanese` that converts an integer between 0 and 99 into Japanese. We need to use this function to print the sum in Japanese.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is understanding how the modulo operation works and how to use the given function `int2Japanese` to convert the sum into Japanese. 

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the number of integers `n`.
2. Initialize a variable `y` to store the sum of the numbers.
3. Read `n` numbers and add each one to `y`. After adding each number, take the modulo 100 of `y` to ensure it stays within the range 0-99.
4. After reading all the numbers, `y` will contain the sum modulo 100.
5. Call the function `int2Japanese` with `y` as the argument to convert the sum into Japanese.
6. Print the result.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n) because we are reading `n` numbers and adding them. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the numbers and the sum.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward once we understand the problem and the algorithm. The only tricky part might be understanding how the modulo operation works. The modulo operation returns the remainder of a division. In this case, we are using it to ensure that the sum stays within the range 0-99.

# Solution Code
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char *int2Japanese(int);

int main()
{
    int n, i, y = 0;
    int x[1000];
    
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &x[i]);
    }
    
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        y+=x[i];
        y = y%100;
    }
    
    printf("%s\n", int2Japanese(y));
    
    return 0;
}

char *int2Japanese(int num)
{
    int d, u;
    char *str = new char [100];
    
    if(num == 0)
        strcpy(str,"zero");
    else if(num == 1)
        strcpy(str,"ichi");
    else if(num == 2)
        strcpy(str,"ni");
    else if(num == 3)
        strcpy(str,"zan");
    else if(num == 4)
        strcpy(str,"yong");
    else if(num == 5)
        strcpy(str,"go");
    else if(num == 6)
        strcpy(str,"loku");
    else if(num == 7)
        strcpy(str,"nana");
    else if(num == 8)
        strcpy(str,"hatchi");
    else if(num == 9)
        strcpy(str,"qiu");
    else if(num == 10)
        strcpy(str,"yu");
    else if(num > 10 && num < 20)
    {
        strcpy(str,"yu ");
        strcat(str,int2Japanese(num%10));
    }
    else if(num >= 20 && num < 100)
    {
        d = num/10;
        u = num%10;
        
        strcpy(str,int2Japanese(d));
        strcat(str, "yu");
        
        if(u != 0)
        {
            strcat(str," ");
            strcat(str,int2Japanese(u));
        }
    }
    
    return str;
}
```
In the solution code, we first read the number of integers `n`. Then we read `n` numbers and add each one to `y`, taking the modulo 100 of `y` after each addition. Finally, we call the function `int2Japanese` to convert the sum into Japanese and print the result.
