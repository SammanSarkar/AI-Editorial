# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to perform a series of iterative calculations on two input numbers, $A$ and $B$, and print their final values. The calculations are performed in a nested loop structure where the outer loop continues until either $A$ or $B$ is greater than or equal to 4000. The inner loop performs some calculations on $A$ and $B$ five times, and then there is another loop that increments $B$ by 3 until it is greater than or equal to 100.

# Key Insights
The key to solving this problem is understanding the loop structure and the calculations that are performed within each loop. We need to carefully implement the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring that the loops terminate at the correct conditions and that the calculations are performed correctly.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the input values of $A$ and $B$.
2. Start a loop that continues until either $A$ or $B$ is greater than or equal to 4000.
3. Inside this loop, start another loop that runs five times. In each iteration of this loop:
   - Add the current value of $B$ to $A$.
   - Divide $B$ by 2.
4. After the inner loop, start another loop that continues until $B$ is greater than or equal to 100. In each iteration of this loop, add 3 to $B$.
5. After all loops have terminated, print the final values of $A$ and $B$.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the maximum of $A$ and $B$. This is because the outer loop runs until either $A$ or $B$ is greater than or equal to 4000, and within this loop, we perform a constant number of operations.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the input values and perform the calculations.

# Implementation Details
The solution is straightforward and does not involve any tricky implementation details. The only thing to be careful about is to ensure that the loops terminate at the correct conditions and that the calculations are performed correctly.

# Solution Code
```cpp17-gcc
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    // Read the input values
    int A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;
    
    // Outer loop
    while(A < 4000 && B < 4000){
        // Inner loop
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            A += B;  // Add the current value of B to A
            B /= 2;  // Divide B by 2
        }
        
        // Another loop to increment B until it is >= 100
        while(B < 100){
            B += 3;
        }
    }
    
    // Print the final values of A and B
    cout << A << " " << B << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the input values of $A$ and $B$. It then starts the outer loop, which continues until either $A$ or $B$ is greater than or equal to 4000. Inside this loop, it starts another loop that runs five times, performing the calculations described in the problem statement. After this loop, it starts another loop that increments $B$ by 3 until it is greater than or equal to 100. Finally, it prints the final values of $A$ and $B$.
