# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except if it is divisible by 100. However, if a year is divisible by both 100 and 400, it is also a leap year. We need to print 'S' if the year is a leap year and 'N' otherwise.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is understanding the conditions that make a year a leap year. We need to check if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by both 100 and 400.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the year from the input.
2. Check if the year is divisible by 4.
3. If it is, check if it is also divisible by 100.
4. If it is divisible by 100, check if it is also divisible by 400.
5. If the year is divisible by 4 and not by 100, or if it is divisible by both 100 and 400, print 'S'. Otherwise, print 'N'.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are only performing a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1) because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward once we understand the conditions for a year to be a leap year. The only tricky part might be understanding that we need to check for divisibility by 400 only if the year is divisible by 100.

# Solution Code
```c11-gcc
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    // Read the year from the input
    int year;
    scanf("%d", &year);

    // Check if the year is a leap year
    if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
        // The year is a leap year
        printf("S");
    } else {
        // The year is not a leap year
        printf("N");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the year from the input. It then checks if the year is a leap year by checking if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by both 100 and 400. If the year is a leap year, it prints 'S'. Otherwise, it prints 'N'.
