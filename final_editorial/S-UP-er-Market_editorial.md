# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to find the combination of products that will maximize the value of the shopping cart without exceeding the cart's weight capacity. Each product has a weight and a value. We need to select products such that the total weight of the selected products does not exceed the weight capacity of the cart and the total value of the selected products is maximized.

# Key Insights
The main insight to solve this problem is recognizing it as a variant of the classic 0/1 Knapsack problem. This problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, where we are trying to maximize the total value while staying within the weight limit. The 0/1 Knapsack problem is solved using dynamic programming or backtracking.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Initialize an array `X` to keep track of whether a product is selected or not, and an array `Y` to store the final selection of products that gives the maximum value.
2. Initialize `maxVal` to -1 to keep track of the maximum value obtained so far.
3. Call the `superMarket` function with parameters `k=0` (current product), `w=0` (current total weight), and `c=0` (current total value).
4. In the `superMarket` function, check if we have considered all products. If we have, compare the current total value `c` with `maxVal`. If `c` is greater than `maxVal`, update `maxVal` and copy the current selection of products from `X` to `Y`.
5. If we have not considered all products, consider two scenarios: one where we do not add the current product to the cart, and one where we do. For the latter, we only proceed if adding the current product does not exceed the weight capacity.
6. After considering all products, print the final selection of products from the `Y` array.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(2^n) because in the worst case, we have to explore all possible combinations of products. The space complexity is O(n) because we are using extra space for the `X` and `Y` arrays, where `n` is the number of products.

# Implementation Details
The tricky part of the implementation is the recursive function `superMarket`. We need to carefully handle the two scenarios where we do not add the current product to the cart and where we do. Also, we need to make sure to reset the selection of the current product in `X` after exploring the scenario where we add the current product to the cart.

# Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int W[21], C[21], X[21], Y[21];
int n, m, maxVal;

// Recursive function to explore all possible combinations of products
void superMarket(int k, int w, int c)
{
    if(k == n)
    {
        if(c > maxVal)
        {
            maxVal = c;
            for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
                Y[i] = X[i];
        }
        return;
    }
    
    // Scenario where we do not add the current product to the cart
    superMarket(k+1,w,c);
    
    // Scenario where we add the current product to the cart
    if(w + W[k] <= m)
    {
        X[k] = 1;
        superMarket(k+1, w+W[k], c+C[k]);
        X[k] = 0;
    }
}

int main()
{
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        cin >> W[i] >> C[i];
    
    maxVal = -1;
    superMarket(0,0,0);
    
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        cout << Y[i] << " ";
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
This solution first reads the number of products and the weight capacity of the cart. Then it reads the weight and value of each product. It calls the `superMarket` function to find the maximum value and the selection of products that give this maximum value. Finally, it prints the selection of products.
