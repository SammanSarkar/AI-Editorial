# Problem Analysis

The problem is asking to calculate the modulus of a number raised to a power. In mathematical terms, we are given three numbers `a`, `b`, and `m` and we need to calculate `(a^b) mod m`. 

# Key Insights

The key insight to solve this problem is understanding the properties of modulus and exponentiation. Specifically, `(a*b) mod m = ((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m`. This property allows us to calculate the modulus at each step of the exponentiation, which can greatly reduce the size of the numbers we are working with.

# Algorithm/Approach

The solution uses a technique called "Exponentiation by Squaring" to calculate the power of a number. This technique reduces the number of multiplications needed to calculate `a^b` from `b` to `log(b)`, which is a significant improvement when `b` is large.

Here are the steps of the algorithm:

1. Initialize the result (`res`) to 1 and the base (`p`) to `a mod m`.
2. While `b` is greater than 0, do the following:
   - If `b` is odd, multiply `res` by `p` and take the modulus `m` of the result.
   - Divide `b` by 2 (effectively reducing the power by half).
   - Square `p` and take the modulus `m` of the result.
3. The final value of `res` is `(a^b) mod m`.

# Time & Space Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(log b) because we are reducing `b` by half at each step of the algorithm. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the variables `a`, `b`, `m`, `res`, and `p`.

# Implementation Details

The implementation uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if `b` is odd. This is equivalent to checking if `b mod 2` is 1, but is faster to compute.

# Solution Code

Here is a well-commented, clean readable version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate (a^b) mod m
long long Power(long long a, long long b, long long m) {
    // Initialize the result and the base
    long long res = 1;
    long long p = a % m;

    // While b is greater than 0
    while (b > 0) {
        // If b is odd
        if (b & 1) {
            // Multiply res by p and take the modulus m of the result
            res = (res * p) % m;
        }

        // Divide b by 2
        b >>= 1;

        // Square p and take the modulus m of the result
        p = (p * p) % m;
    }

    // Return the result
    return res;
}

int main() {
    // Read the input
    long long a, b, m;
    cin >> a >> b >> m;

    // Calculate and print the result
    cout << Power(a, b, m) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the input numbers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calls the `Power` function to calculate `(a^b) mod m` and prints the result. The `Power` function uses the "Exponentiation by Squaring" technique to calculate the power of a number, taking the modulus at each step to keep the numbers small.
