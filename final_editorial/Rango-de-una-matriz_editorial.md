# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to find the rank of a given binary matrix. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors. In simpler terms, it's the count of non-zero rows after the matrix is transformed into row echelon form or reduced row echelon form.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is recognizing that we need to perform Gaussian elimination on the matrix to transform it into row echelon form. In this form, the rank of the matrix is simply the number of non-zero rows.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the input matrix and store it in a bitset array. A bitset is an array that holds binary digits (bits). Each bitset stores up to N bits, where N is an integer value that is passed as a template parameter when declaring the bitset.
2. Initialize an array `representando` of size `n` with all elements as false. This array will be used to keep track of which rows are being represented in the matrix.
3. Perform Gaussian elimination on the matrix. For each column `x`, find a row `i` which is not yet represented and has a 1 in column `x`. Mark this row as represented and for all rows `j` below `i`, if they have a 1 in column `x`, XOR them with row `i`.
4. After the Gaussian elimination, count the number of non-zero rows in the matrix. This is the rank of the matrix.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n^3) because there are three nested loops: the outer loop runs `n` times, the middle loop also runs `n` times and the innermost loop runs `n` times as well in the worst case. The space complexity is O(n^2) because we are storing the matrix in a 2D bitset array.

# Implementation Details
The implementation uses the C++ `bitset` library to store the binary matrix. The `bitset` library provides a convenient way to work with binary numbers. The `bitset::any()` function is used to check if there is any bit set in the bitset. The `bitset::operator^=` is used to perform the XOR operation on two bitsets.

# Solution Code
```cpp
#include <bitset> 
#include <iostream> 

int main() { 
    int n; 
    std::cin >> n; 

    std::bitset<1000> clausulas[n]; 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) { 
            int v; 
            std::cin >> v; 
            clausulas[i][j] = v; 
        } 
    } 

    bool representando[n] = { }; 
    for (int x = 0; x < n; ++x) { 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
            if (!representando[i] && clausulas[i][x]) { 
                representando[i] = true; 
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) { 
                    if (clausulas[j][x]) { 
                        clausulas[j] ^= clausulas[i]; 
                    } 
                } 
                break; 
            } 
        } 
    } 

    int rango = 0; 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { 
        rango += clausulas[i].any(); 
    } 

    std::cout << rango; 
}
```
In the solution code, the matrix is read and stored in a 2D bitset array. Then, Gaussian elimination is performed on the matrix. After the matrix is in row echelon form, the rank of the matrix is calculated by counting the number of non-zero rows.
