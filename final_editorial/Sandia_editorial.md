# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking to determine if a watermelon of weight `N` kilos can be divided into two parts such that each part weighs an even number of kilos and is greater than zero. 

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is understanding that any even number greater than 2 can be divided into two even numbers. This is because an even number is divisible by 2 and if the number is greater than 2, both parts will be greater than zero.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the weight of the watermelon `N`.
2. If `N` is greater than 2 and even, print "SI". This is because any even number greater than 2 can be divided into two even numbers.
3. If `N` is not greater than 2 or is odd, print "NO". This is because an odd number cannot be divided into two even numbers and a number less than or equal to 2 cannot be divided into two parts greater than zero.
4. End

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it only requires one operation, which is checking if the number is even and greater than 2. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only requires one variable to store the weight of the watermelon.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward. The only tricky part might be understanding why any even number greater than 2 can be divided into two even numbers. This is because an even number is divisible by 2 and if the number is greater than 2, both parts will be greater than zero.

# Solution Code
```cpp11-gcc
//Author: Morales Alcántar María Magdalena
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
    
    int n;
    
    cin>>n;
    
    // If n is greater than 2 and even, print "SI"
    if(n > 2 && n % 2 == 0){
        cout<<"SI"<<endl;
    }
    // If n is not greater than 2 or is odd, print "NO"
    else{
        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
This solution works because any even number greater than 2 can be divided into two even numbers. If the number is not greater than 2 or is odd, it cannot be divided into two even parts greater than zero.
