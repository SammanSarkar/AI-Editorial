# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to generate a series of numbers starting from two given single-digit numbers. The next number in the series is the sum of the last two numbers, but only the least significant digit of the sum is considered. This process continues until the series loops back to the original two numbers. The output should be the complete series and the number of steps it took to return to the original numbers.

# Key Insights
The key to solving this problem is understanding the concept of modulo operation. The modulo operation finds the remainder of division of one number by another. In this problem, we use it to get the least significant digit of the sum of two numbers. 

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the two input numbers.
2. Start a counter to keep track of the number of steps.
3. Print the two input numbers.
4. Enter a loop that continues until the last two numbers in the series are the same as the input numbers.
    1. Increment the counter.
    2. Calculate the sum of the last two numbers in the series.
    3. Use the modulo operation to get the least significant digit of the sum.
    4. Print the least significant digit.
    5. Update the last two numbers in the series.
5. Print the counter.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of steps it takes for the series to return to the original numbers. This is because we perform a constant amount of work in each iteration of the loop.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of space to store the input numbers, the sum, and the counter.

# Implementation Details
The tricky part of this problem is ensuring that the loop continues until the series returns to the original numbers. This is done by using a do-while loop, which always executes at least once, and checking in the loop condition whether the last two numbers in the series are the same as the input numbers.

# Solution Code
```cpp20-clang
#include<iostream> 

int main (){ 
   // Read the input numbers
   int d1,d2; 
   std::cin>>d1>>d2; 

   // Initialize the sum and counter
   int sum1 = d1, sum2 = d2, sum3 , counter = 0; 

   // Print the input numbers
   std::cout<< d1 << " " << d2; 

   // Generate the series
   do{ 
      // Increment the counter
      counter+= 1; 

      // Calculate the least significant digit of the sum
      sum3 = (sum1 + sum2) % 10; 

      // Print the least significant digit
      std::cout<< " " << sum3; 

      // Update the last two numbers in the series
      sum1 = sum2; 
      sum2 = sum3; 
   } while (sum1 != d1 || sum2 != d2); 

   // Print the counter
   std::cout<<"\n"<<counter; 

   return 0; 
}
```
This code reads the input numbers, initializes the sum and counter, and prints the input numbers. It then enters a loop where it increments the counter, calculates the least significant digit of the sum, prints this digit, and updates the last two numbers in the series. The loop continues until the series returns to the original numbers. Finally, the code prints the counter.
