# Problem Analysis

The problem is asking us to find the minimum total cost of moving from one point to another in a 2D grid. The cost of moving from one cell to another is the value of the cell we are moving to. We can move to any of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) from a cell.

# Key Insights

The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that it can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a graph from a source node to all other nodes. In this problem, the 2D grid can be thought of as a graph where each cell is a node and the cost of moving from one cell to another is the edge weight.

# Algorithm/Approach

1. Read the input and store the grid in a 2D array.
2. For each query, apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum cost from the source cell to the destination cell.
3. To apply Dijkstra's algorithm, initialize a priority queue where each element is a tuple consisting of the cost, and the x and y coordinates of a cell. The priority queue is ordered by the cost in ascending order.
4. Start by adding the source cell to the priority queue with a cost equal to the value of the cell.
5. While the priority queue is not empty, remove the cell with the smallest cost. For each of its adjacent cells, if moving to the cell results in a smaller cost, update the cost and add the cell to the priority queue.
6. The minimum cost from the source cell to the destination cell is the cost of the destination cell after applying Dijkstra's algorithm.
7. Print the minimum cost for each query.

# Time & Space Complexity

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O((V+E)logV) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. In this problem, V is the number of cells in the grid and E is the number of edges between the cells, which is 4 times the number of cells. Therefore, the time complexity is O((N*M + 4*N*M)log(N*M)) = O(N*M*log(N*M)).

The space complexity is O(N*M) for storing the grid and the cost of each cell.

# Implementation Details

The implementation uses a priority queue to store the cells to be visited. The priority queue is ordered by the cost in ascending order, so the cell with the smallest cost is always at the top of the queue. The cost of each cell is initially set to infinity and is updated as we find a path with a smaller cost.

# Solution Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int INF = 1e9;
const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
const int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
typedef tuple<int, int, int> node;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    // Read the input
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<vector<int>> a(n, vector<int>(m));
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        for (int j=0; j<m; j++)
            cin >> a[i][j];
    int q;
    cin >> q;
    vector<array<int, 5>> queries;
    for (int i=0; i<q; i++) {
        int r1, c1, r2, c2;
        cin >> r1 >> c1 >> r2 >> c2;
        queries.push_back({r1, c1, r2, c2, i});
    }

    // Initialize the cost of each cell to infinity
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dist(n, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(m, INF)));

    // Apply Dijkstra's algorithm
    auto dijkstra = [&] (int s, int t, int l, int r) {
        priority_queue<node, vector<node>, greater<node>> pq;
        pq.emplace(dist[s][s][t] = a[s][t], s, t);
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [d, x, y] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            if (d > dist[s][x][y])
                continue;
            for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {
                int nx = x + dx[i], ny = y + dy[i];
                if (0 <= nx && nx < n && l <= ny && ny <= r && d + a[nx][ny] < dist[s][nx][ny])
                    pq.emplace(dist[s][nx][ny] = d + a[nx][ny], nx, ny);
            }
        }
    };

    // Solve the problem for each query
    vector<int> ret(q, INF);
    auto solve = [&] (auto &self, int l, int r, const vector<array<int, 5>> &queries) {
        if (l > r)
            return;
        int x = (l + r) / 2;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
            dijkstra(i, x, l, r);
        vector<array<int, 5>> left, right;
        for (auto [r1, c1, r2, c2, i] : queries) {
            for (int j=0; j<n; j++)
                ret[i] = min(ret[i], dist[j][r1][c1] + dist[j][r2][c2] - a[j][x]);
            if (c1 < x && c2 < x)
                left.push_back({r1, c1, r2, c2, i});
            else if (c1 > x && c2 > x)
                right.push_back({r1, c1, r2, c2, i});
        }
        self(self, l, x - 1, left);
        self(self, x + 1, r, right);
    };

    solve(solve, 0, m - 1, queries);
    for (int x : ret)
        cout << x << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the input and stores the grid in a 2D array. It then applies Dijkstra's algorithm for each query to find the minimum cost from the source cell to the destination cell. The minimum cost is printed for each query.
