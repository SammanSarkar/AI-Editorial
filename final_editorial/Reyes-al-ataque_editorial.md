# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to calculate the maximum number of kings that can be placed on a given chessboard such that no two kings can attack each other. In addition, we are also asked to find the number of unique ways to place this maximum number of kings. The chessboard is represented as a 2D grid of size N x N, where some cells are marked as forbidden (represented by 'X') and the rest are free (represented by '.'). Kings cannot be placed on forbidden cells.

# Key Insights
1. A king in chess can move one step in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. So, if a king is placed on a cell, the neighboring cells in all eight directions become forbidden for placing another king.
2. We can use a recursive function (backtracking) to explore all possible placements of kings on the chessboard.
3. To optimize the recursive function, we can use a pruning strategy: if the current number of placed kings plus the maximum possible number of kings that can be placed on the remaining cells is less than the best solution found so far, we can stop exploring this branch of the recursion tree.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Initialize a 2D array 'influence' to keep track of the influence of placed kings on the chessboard cells.
2. Define a recursive function 'f' that takes as parameters the current cell (i, j), the number of kings already placed 'puestos', and the number of free cells left 'ver'.
3. In the function 'f', first check if the current solution can potentially be better than the best solution found so far. If not, return immediately (pruning).
4. If the current cell is outside the chessboard, update the best solution and the count of ways to achieve it if necessary, and return.
5. Try two possibilities: not placing a king on the current cell, and placing a king on the current cell (if it's a free cell and not influenced by any king).
6. If a king is placed on the current cell, update the 'influence' array accordingly, and undo this update after the recursive call.
7. Call the function 'f' initially with the top-left cell (0, 0), zero kings placed, and the total number of free cells.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity is O(2^(N^2)) because in the worst case, we have to explore all possible ways to place kings on N^2 cells. The space complexity is O(N^2) for storing the chessboard and the 'influence' array.

# Implementation Details
1. The 'influence' array is used to keep track of the influence of placed kings on the chessboard cells. If 'influence[i][j]' is non-zero, it means that a king cannot be placed on cell (i, j).
2. The 'mapa' array stores the chessboard. 'mapa[i][j]' is '.' if cell (i, j) is free, and 'X' otherwise.
3. The variables 'mejor_sol' and 'contador' store the maximum number of kings that can be placed and the number of ways to achieve this, respectively.
4. The function 'f' is implemented as a recursive function (backtracking). It tries to place a king on the current cell (if possible), and then moves to the next cell. It also tries not placing a king on the current cell and moving to the next cell. It uses the 'influence' array to check if a king can be placed on the current cell.
5. The function 'f' uses a pruning strategy to optimize the recursion. If the current number of placed kings plus the maximum possible number of kings that can be placed on the remaining cells is less than 'mejor_sol', it returns immediately.
6. The function 'main' reads the input, calls the function 'f', and prints the output.

# Solution Code
```cpp20-gcc
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int n;
int influencia[20][20] = { };
char mapa[20][20 + 1];
int mejor_sol = 0, contador = 0;

void f(int i, int j, int puestos, int ver) {
   // Pruning: if the current solution cannot be better than the best solution found so far, return immediately
   if (puestos + (ver + ver % 2) / 2 < mejor_sol) {
      return;
   }

   // If the current cell is outside the chessboard
   if (i == n) {
      // Update the best solution and the count of ways to achieve it if necessary
      if (puestos >= mejor_sol) {
         if (puestos > mejor_sol) {
            mejor_sol = puestos;
            contador = 0;
         }
         contador += 1;
      }
   } else if (j == n) { // If the current cell is outside the current row
      // Move to the next row
      f(i + 1, 0, puestos, ver);
   } else {
      // Try not placing a king on the current cell and moving to the next cell
      f(i, j + 1, puestos, ver - 1);

      // If the current cell is free and not influenced by any king
      if (mapa[i][j] == '.' && influencia[i][j] == 0) {
         // Place a king on the current cell and update the 'influence' array
         for (int x = i - 1; x <= i + 1; ++x) {
            for (int y = j - 1; y <= j + 1; ++y) {
               if (0 <= x && x < n && 0 <= y && y < n) {
                  influencia[x][y] += 1;
               }
            }
         }

         // Try placing a king on the current cell and moving to the next cell
         f(i, j + 1, puestos + 1, ver - 1);

         // Undo the update of the 'influence' array
         for (int x = i - 1; x <= i + 1; ++x) {
            for (int y = j - 1; y <= j + 1; ++y) {
               if (0 <= x && x < n && 0 <= y && y < n) {
                  influencia[x][y] -= 1;
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
}

int main( ) {
   // Read the input
   scanf("%d", &n);
   for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      scanf("%s", &mapa[i][0]);
   }

   // Call the function 'f'
   f(0, 0, 0, n * n);

   // Print the output
   printf("%d %d", mejor_sol, contador);
}
```
This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible placements of kings on the chessboard. It uses a pruning strategy to optimize the recursion. It also uses a 2D array to keep track of the influence of placed kings on the chessboard cells.
