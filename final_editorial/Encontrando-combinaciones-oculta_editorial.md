# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking to find the number of occurrences of a specific sequence of cards in a given series of cards. The series of cards is represented as a string where each character represents a card. The sequence to be found is also represented as a string. We need to find how many times the sequence string appears in the series string.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is understanding that we can solve this problem by iterating over the series string and checking for the sequence string at each position. This is a standard string matching problem.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Initialize a counter variable to 0. This will keep track of the number of times the sequence string appears in the series string.
2. Iterate over the series string. For each position in the series string:
    1. If the sequence string matches the substring of the series string starting at the current position, increment the counter.
3. Print the counter.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n*m), where n is the length of the series string and m is the length of the sequence string. This is because for each position in the series string, we are checking if the sequence string matches the substring of the series string starting at that position.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

# Implementation Details
The tricky part of the implementation is checking if the sequence string matches the substring of the series string starting at a certain position. This is done by iterating over the sequence string and the series string simultaneously and checking if the characters match.

# Solution Code
```py2
# Read the series and sequence strings
f = raw_input()
s = raw_input()

# Initialize the counter
cont = 0

# Iterate over the series string
for i in range(len(f)):
    # Initialize the indices for the series and sequence strings
    indiceF = i
    indiceC = 0
    
    # While the characters of the series and sequence strings match, increment the indices
    while indiceC < len(s) and s[indiceC] == f[indiceF]:
        indiceC += 1
        indiceF += 1
    
    # If the entire sequence string has been matched, increment the counter
    if indiceC == len(s):
        cont += 1
    
    # Reset the index for the sequence string
    indiceC = 0

# Print the counter
print cont
```
This solution works by checking for the sequence string at each position in the series string. If the sequence string is found, the counter is incremented. The indices for the series and sequence strings are reset for each position in the series string.
