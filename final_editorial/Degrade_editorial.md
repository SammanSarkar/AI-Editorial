# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to determine if a given 2D matrix has either all rows or all columns with the same elements, but not both. If all rows have the same elements, we print "HORIZONTAL". If all columns have the same elements, we print "VERTICAL". If neither condition is met, we print "NADA".

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that we need to check each row and each column separately to see if they contain the same elements. We also need to ensure that no two adjacent rows or columns are the same. 

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the input matrix.
2. Check each row to see if all elements are the same. If any row has different elements, set a boolean flag `hor` to false. If all rows have the same elements but no two adjacent rows are the same, set `hor` to true.
3. Check each column to see if all elements are the same. If any column has different elements, set a boolean flag `ver` to false. If all columns have the same elements but no two adjacent columns are the same, set `ver` to true.
4. If both `hor` and `ver` are true, it means the matrix is both horizontally and vertically homogeneous, which is not allowed. In this case, we assert to ensure this does not happen.
5. If `ver` is true, print "VERTICAL". If `hor` is true, print "HORIZONTAL". If neither is true, print "NADA".

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m) because we iterate over each element of the matrix twice, once for checking rows and once for checking columns. The space complexity is O(n*m) because we store the entire matrix in memory.

# Implementation Details
The implementation uses two helper functions `checkver()` and `checkhor()` to check if the matrix is vertically or horizontally homogeneous, respectively. These functions iterate over the matrix and check the conditions as described in the algorithm.

# Solution Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
bool hor = false, ver = false;
int ma[1000][1000];

// Function to check if the matrix is vertically homogeneous
bool checkver() {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < m-1; j++) {
            if (ma[i][j] != ma[i][j+1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        if (ma[i][0] == ma[i+1][0]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to check if the matrix is horizontally homogeneous
bool checkhor() {
    for(int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            if (ma[i][j] != ma[i+1][j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    for(int j = 0; j < m-1; j++) {
        if (ma[0][j] == ma[0][j+1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    cin >> n >> m;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) for(int j = 0; j < m; j++) cin >> ma[i][j];

    ver = checkver();
    hor = checkhor();
    assert(not (hor and ver));
    
    if (ver) cout << "VERTICAL" << endl;
    else if (hor) cout << "HORIZONTAL" << endl;
    else cout << "NADA" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the input matrix, then checks if the matrix is vertically and horizontally homogeneous using the helper functions. It then prints the result based on the boolean flags `ver` and `hor`.
