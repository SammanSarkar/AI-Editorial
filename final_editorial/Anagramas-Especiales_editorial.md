# Editorial for Anagramas Especiales

## Problem Analysis

The problem is asking for the count of special anagrams of a string `s1` that can be found in another string `s2`. A special anagram is a string that can be formed by permuting the characters of another string, including the string itself. For example, the special anagrams of the string `ABC` are `ABC`, `ACB`, `BCA`, `BAC`, `CBA`, and `CAB`.

## Key Insights

The key insight to solve this problem is to understand that we can use a sliding window approach to check for anagrams. We can create two frequency arrays, one for `s1` and another for the current window of `s2`. If the two frequency arrays are identical, then the current window of `s2` is an anagram of `s1`.

## Algorithm/Approach

1. Initialize a counter to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of anagrams of `s1` found in `s2`.
2. Create two frequency arrays `pattern_array` and `txt_array` of size 256 (the number of ASCII characters) and initialize them to 0.
3. For the first `|s1|` characters of `s2`, increment the corresponding index in `txt_array` and `pattern_array`.
4. Slide the window over `s2` from index `|s1|` to `|s2|`. For each window, increment the count of the new character in `txt_array` and decrement the count of the character going out of the window in `txt_array`.
5. After each slide, compare `pattern_array` and `txt_array`. If they are identical, increment the counter.
6. After the last slide, compare `pattern_array` and `txt_array` one last time. If they are identical, increment the counter.
7. Return the counter.

## Time & Space Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of `s2`. This is because we are sliding a window over `s2` and performing constant time operations for each window.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the frequency arrays and a few variables. Note that the space complexity is not dependent on the size of the input strings.

## Implementation Details

The function `compare` is used to compare two frequency arrays. It returns true if the arrays are identical and false otherwise.

The function `optimized_solution` implements the sliding window approach described above. It first initializes the frequency arrays for the first window and then slides the window over `s2`, updating the frequency arrays and checking for anagrams after each slide.

## Solution Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

#define MAX_VAL 256

using namespace std;

bool compare(const char *pattern_arr, const char *txt_arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VAL; i++) 
        if (pattern_arr[i] != txt_arr[i]) 
            return false;
    return true;
}

int optimized_solution(const string &pattern, const string &txt) {
    int counter = 0;
    int pattern_size = pattern.length(), txt_size = txt.length();
    char pattern_array[MAX_VAL] = {0}, txt_array[MAX_VAL] = {0};

    for (int i = 0; i < pattern_size; ++i) {
        ++pattern_array[pattern[i]];
        ++txt_array[txt[i]];
    }

    for (int i = pattern_size; i < txt_size; ++i) {
        if (compare(pattern_array, txt_array)) 
            ++counter;
        ++txt_array[txt[i]];
        --txt_array[txt[i - pattern_size]];
    }

    if (compare(pattern_array, txt_array))
        ++counter;

    return counter;
}

int main() {
    string s1, s2;
    cin >> s1 >> s2;
    cout << optimized_solution(s1, s2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the input strings `s1` and `s2`, calls the `optimized_solution` function to get the count of anagrams of `s1` in `s2`, and then prints the result.
