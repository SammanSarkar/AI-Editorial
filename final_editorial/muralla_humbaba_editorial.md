# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to determine the minimum number of walls that can form the wall around the forest. We are given a string that represents the sequence of colors of the walls as seen by Gilgamesh and Enkidu. They are not sure if they have returned to the starting point after completing a round. The color of the walls can be either black or white, represented by 'N' and 'B' respectively in the string.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to recognize that the sequence of colors will repeat after the heroes complete a round. Therefore, we need to find the smallest repeating substring in the given string. The length of this smallest repeating substring will be the minimum number of walls that can form the wall around the forest.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the input string.
2. Start a loop from the second character of the string. For each character, start another loop from the current character to the end of the string. In this inner loop, compare the current character with the character at the same position in the substring starting from the beginning of the string and of length equal to the outer loop counter.
3. If the characters are not the same, break the inner loop and move to the next character in the outer loop.
4. If the inner loop completes, that means we have found the smallest repeating substring. Break the outer loop.
5. The counter of the outer loop will be the minimum number of walls that can form the wall around the forest.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, we are potentially comparing it with every other character in the string.

The space complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are storing the input string in memory.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward once we understand the approach. The only tricky part is to make sure that we are comparing the correct characters in the inner loop. We use the modulo operator to wrap around to the beginning of the string when we reach the end.

# Solution Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#define MAX 100010
using namespace std;

string muralla;

int main(){
    // Read the input string
    cin >> muralla;
    
    // Start a loop from the second character of the string
    for(int i = 1; i < muralla.size(); i++){
        int j = i;
        
        // Start another loop from the current character to the end of the string
        for(int k = 0; j < muralla.size() && muralla[j] == muralla[k]; j++, k = (k+1)%i);
        
        // If the inner loop completes, that means we have found the smallest repeating substring
        if(j == muralla.size())
            break;
    }
    
    // The counter of the outer loop will be the minimum number of walls that can form the wall around the forest
    cout << i << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
This solution reads the input string, finds the smallest repeating substring, and prints the length of this substring, which is the minimum number of walls that can form the wall around the forest.
