# Problem Analysis

The problem is asking us to determine the season of a given date. The date is provided as two integers, the day and the month. The seasons are defined as follows:

- Winter: December 21 to March 20
- Spring: March 21 to June 21
- Summer: June 22 to September 22
- Fall: September 23 to December 20

If the date is not valid, we should return a message saying "no existe la fecha" (the date does not exist).

# Key Insights

The key to solving this problem is understanding how to use conditional statements and switch cases effectively. We need to check the month and day to determine the season. We also need to validate the date, checking that the day is within the valid range for the given month.

# Algorithm/Approach

1. Read the day and month from the input.
2. Use a switch case to check the month.
3. For each month, check the day and determine the season. For example, if the month is March and the day is less than or equal to 20, the season is Winter. If the day is between 21 and 31, the season is Spring.
4. If the day is not within the valid range for the month, print "no existe la fecha".
5. Repeat this process for all months.

# Time & Space Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(1) because we are only performing a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size.

The space complexity is also O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the day and month.

# Implementation Details

The implementation is straightforward once we understand the problem and the approach. We need to be careful with the date validation, making sure we check the correct range for each month. For example, February only has 28 days, so we need to check that the day is between 1 and 28 for this month.

# Solution Code

```c11-gcc
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	int m,d;
	
	// Read the day and month from the input
	fscanf(stdin,"%d %d",&d,&m);
	
	// Use a switch case to check the month
	switch(m){
		case 1:
		case 2:
			// For January and February, the season is Winter if the day is valid
			if(d>=1 && d<=(m==2?28:31)) fprintf(stdout,"Winter");
			else fprintf(stdout,"no existe la fecha");
			break;
		case 3:
		case 4:
		case 5:
		case 6:
			// For March to June, check the day to determine the season
			if(d>=1 && d<=(m%2==1?31:30)) fprintf(stdout,m==3 && d<21?"Winter":m==6 && d>21?"Summer":"Spring");
			else fprintf(stdout,"no existe la fecha");
			break;
		case 7:
		case 8:
			// For July and August, the season is Summer if the day is valid
			if(d>=1 && d<=31) fprintf(stdout,"Summer");
			else fprintf(stdout,"no existe la fecha");
			break;
		case 9:
		case 10:
		case 11:
		case 12:
			// For September to December, check the day to determine the season
			if(d>=1 && d<=(m%2==0?31:30)) fprintf(stdout,m==9 && d<23?"Summer":m==12 && d>21?"Winter":"Fall");
			else fprintf(stdout,"no existe la fecha");
			break;
		default:
			// If the month is not between 1 and 12, the date is not valid
			fprintf(stdout,"no existe la fecha");
	}
	
	return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the day and month from the input. Then it uses a switch case to check the month. For each month, it checks the day and determines the season. If the day is not within the valid range for the month, it prints "no existe la fecha".
