# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to implement a compression and decompression algorithm for strings. The algorithm is based on the concept of homogeneous maximal substrings, which are substrings where all characters are the same and cannot be extended further on either side. The compression of these substrings is done using a binary representation of the length of the substring minus 2. If the length of the substring is 1, it remains the same. If it is greater than or equal to 2, it is represented by a prelude followed by the repeated character. The prelude is constructed from the binary representation of the length minus 2, divided into bytes with the most significant bit set to 1.

# Key Insights
The key to solving this problem is understanding how the compression and decompression algorithm works. For compression, we need to identify the homogeneous maximal substrings and calculate their lengths. Then, we use the binary representation of the length minus 2 to create the prelude. For decompression, we need to reverse this process by reading the prelude and the following character to reconstruct the original string.

# Algorithm/Approach
## Compression
1. Read the input string character by character.
2. Keep track of the current character and its count.
3. If the next character is the same, increment the count.
4. If the next character is different, check the count.
    - If the count is 1, output the character.
    - If the count is greater than or equal to 2, calculate the binary representation of the count minus 2 and output the prelude followed by the character.
5. Repeat this process until the end of the string.

## Decompression
1. Read the input string character by character.
2. If the most significant bit of the current character is 1, it is part of the prelude. Read the prelude and calculate the length of the homogeneous maximal substring.
3. If the most significant bit of the current character is 0, it is the repeated character. Output the character repeated the calculated number of times.
4. Repeat this process until the end of the string.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of both the compression and decompression algorithms is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are processing each character of the string exactly once.

The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the compressed string could be the same length as the original string (when all characters are different).

# Implementation Details
The implementation in C++ uses bitwise operations to manipulate the binary representations of the characters and lengths. The `getchar` function is used to read the input character by character, and the `putchar` function is used to output the compressed or decompressed string.

# Solution Code
```cpp17-gcc
#include<stdio.h> 

int main(){ 
   char x = getchar(); 
   getchar(); 
   if(x=='C'){ 
      char ant=getchar(),act; 
      int cont=1; 
      while(scanf("%c",&act)==1){ 
         if(act==ant){ 
            cont++; 
         }else if(cont==1){ 
            putchar(ant); 
            cont=1; 
         } 
         else{ 
            int m = cont-2; 
            do{ 
               int k = m & 0b1111111; 
               k|= 0b10000000; 
               putchar(k); 
               m>>=7; 
            }while(m!=0); 
            putchar(ant); 
            cont=1; 
         } 
         ant = act; 
      } 
      // Print the last character
      if(cont==1){ 
         printf("%c",ant); 
      }else{ 
         int m = cont-2; 
         do{ 
            int k = m & 0b1111111; 
            k|= 0b10000000; 
            putchar(k); 
            m>>=7; 
         }while(m!=0); 
         putchar(ant); 
      } 
   } 
   else{ 
      char act; 
      int ant,cont=0,esp,asp=1,final=1; 
      while(scanf("%c",&act)==1){ 
         int n = act>>7; 
         if(n){ 
            act = act & 0b01111111; 
            if(cont>0){ 
               esp = act<<(7*cont) ^ ant; 
            }else{ 
               esp = act; 
            } 
            cont++; 
            ant = esp; 
            final = esp+2; 
         }else{ 
            for(int i=0;i<final;++i){ 
               putchar(act); 
            } 
            final = 1; 
            cont = 0; 
         } 
      } 
   } 
}
```
This code first checks whether it needs to compress or decompress based on the first character of the input. It then reads the rest of the input character by character and applies the appropriate algorithm. The compression algorithm keeps track of the current character and its count, and outputs the compressed representation when the character changes. The decompression algorithm reads the prelude and the following character to reconstruct the original string.
