# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking to sort two input integers in ascending order. The input integers can be equal as well. The task is to print the two integers in ascending order.

# Key Insights
The problem is straightforward and does not require any complex algorithms or data structures. The key insight is to understand that we need to compare the two integers and print them in the correct order.

# Algorithm/Approach
Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. Read the two integers from the input.
2. Compare the two integers.
3. If the first integer is greater than the second, print the second integer first and then the first integer.
4. If the second integer is greater than the first, print the first integer first and then the second integer.
5. If both integers are equal, print either integer twice.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are only performing a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) because we are only storing a constant amount of data.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward. We use the standard input/output streams (cin/cout) to read/write the data. The tricky part might be understanding the if-else conditions. We need three separate conditions to handle the three possible cases: first integer greater, second integer greater, or both integers equal.

# Solution Code
Here is a well-commented, clean, and readable version of the solution:

```cpp11-gcc
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main (){
    // Read the two integers from the input
    int x1, x2;
    cin >> x1 >> x2;

    // Compare the two integers and print them in ascending order
    if( x1 > x2 ){
        // If the first integer is greater, print the second integer first
        cout << x2 << endl;
        cout << x1 << endl;
    } else if( x2 > x1 ){
        // If the second integer is greater, print the first integer first
        cout << x1 << endl;
        cout << x2 << endl;
    } else {
        // If both integers are equal, print either integer twice
        cout << x1 << endl;
        cout << x2 << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This solution is simple and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem as stated.
