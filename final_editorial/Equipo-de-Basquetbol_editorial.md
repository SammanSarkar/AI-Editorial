# Problem Analysis
The problem is a simple one. Given a height of a student, we need to check if the student is eligible to be a part of the basketball team. The eligibility criteria is that the student's height should be at least 160 cm. If the student is eligible, we print a welcome message. Otherwise, we print a message saying how many more centimeters the student needs to reach the eligibility criteria.

# Key Insights
This problem does not require any complex algorithms or data structures. It is a simple if-else condition check. The key insight here is to understand the conditional operator in Java, which is used to decide what message to print.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the height of the student.
2. Check if the height is greater than or equal to 160.
3. If it is, print the welcome message.
4. If it is not, calculate the difference between 160 and the student's height, and print a message saying the student needs that many more centimeters to be eligible.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because we are performing a constant amount of work regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space to store the height and the message.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward. We use Java's Scanner class to read the height. Then we use the conditional operator (`?:`) to decide what message to print. The conditional operator takes three operands: a condition, a value to use if the condition is true, and a value to use if the condition is false. In this case, the condition is `estatura >= 160`, the value for true is `"Bienvenido al equipo"`, and the value for false is `"Lo siento, te faltan " + (160-estatura) + " cm para poder entrar al equipo"`.

# Solution Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Create a Scanner to read input
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

		// Read the height
		int estatura = in.nextInt();

		// Decide what message to print
		String mensaje = estatura >= 160 ? 
			"Bienvenido al equipo" : 
			"Lo siento, te faltan " + (160-estatura) + " cm para poder entrar al equipo";
		
		// Print the message
		System.out.println(mensaje);
		
		// Close the Scanner
		in.close();
	}
}
```
This code reads the height, decides what message to print based on the height, and then prints the message. It uses the conditional operator to decide what message to print, which makes the code concise and easy to read.
