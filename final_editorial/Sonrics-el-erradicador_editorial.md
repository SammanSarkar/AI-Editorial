# Problem Analysis

The problem is asking for the weight of the evidence that Commander Sonrics needs to transport. The evidence is represented by the shaded area in the given diagram. We know that for each unit square of the plantation, there are 10 kg of weeds. 

The plantation is a rectangle with dimensions AC and BC. The shaded area is a triangle with base BC and height MP. We know that M is the midpoint of AC, P is the midpoint of MC, and K is the midpoint of BC. 

# Key Insights

The key insight here is to understand that the shaded area is half of the rectangle's area. This is because M is the midpoint of AC, dividing the rectangle into two equal halves. And since P is the midpoint of MC, the shaded triangle is half of one of these halves, i.e., one-fourth of the rectangle.

# Algorithm/Approach

1. Calculate the area of the rectangle. Since we don't have the actual dimensions of the rectangle, we can assume it to be 1 unit. So, the area of the rectangle is 1 unit square.

2. Calculate the area of the shaded triangle, which is one-fourth of the rectangle's area. So, the area of the triangle is 0.25 unit square.

3. Multiply the area of the triangle by the weight of the weeds per unit square to get the weight of the evidence. Since there are 10 kg of weeds per unit square, the weight of the evidence is 0.25 * 10 = 2.5 kg.

# Time & Space Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are performing a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space.

# Implementation Details

This problem does not involve any complex implementation details. We are simply performing arithmetic operations to calculate the weight of the evidence.

# Solution Code

```cpp17-gcc
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // The weight of the evidence is 2.5 kg
    printf("2.5");
    return 0;
}
```

This code prints the weight of the evidence that Commander Sonrics needs to transport. The weight is calculated based on the area of the shaded triangle in the diagram and the weight of the weeds per unit square.
