# Problem Analysis
The problem presents a scenario where a cat, JEMI, is learning to perform operations with integers. However, the operator used in the operation was torn from the paper and we are tasked to find out the operator that was used. We are given the two operands and the result of the operation. If it is not possible to find an operator that would make the operation correct, we should print "D:".

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that there are only four possible operators that could have been used: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). We can simply try each operator and see if it gives us the correct result. If none of them do, then it is not possible to find an operator that would make the operation correct.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the three integers A, B, and C from the input.
2. Check if A + B equals C. If it does, print "+" and return.
3. Check if A - B equals C. If it does, print "-" and return.
4. Check if A * B equals C. If it does, print "*" and return.
5. Check if B is not zero and A / B equals C. If it does, print "/" and return.
6. If none of the above conditions are met, print "D:".

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because we are performing a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space to store the input and intermediate results.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward, with the only tricky part being the division operation. We need to check if B is not zero before performing the division to avoid a division by zero error.

# Solution Code
```cpp20-clang
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Read the input
    int A, B, C;
    cin >> A >> B >> C;

    // Check each operator
    if (A + B == C) {
        cout << "+" << endl;
    } else if (A - B == C) {
        cout << "-" << endl;
    } else if (A * B == C) {
        cout << "*" << endl;
    } else if (B != 0 && A / B == C) {
        // Check if B is not zero before performing the division
        cout << "/" << endl;
    } else {
        // If none of the operators work, print "D:"
        cout << "D:" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This code reads the input, checks each operator to see if it gives the correct result, and prints the operator if it does. If none of the operators work, it prints "D:".
