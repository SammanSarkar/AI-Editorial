# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking to calculate the time required to fill a tank with a capacity of `C` liters using `n` hoses. Each hose provides a different amount of water per minute. 

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is understanding that the total amount of water provided by all hoses per minute is the sum of the individual amounts provided by each hose. Therefore, to find the time required to fill the tank, we divide the tank's capacity by the total amount of water provided by all hoses per minute.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the capacity of the tank and the number of hoses.
2. Initialize a variable `k` to store the total amount of water provided by all hoses per minute.
3. For each hose, read the amount of water it provides per minute and add it to `k`.
4. Calculate the time required to fill the tank by dividing the tank's capacity by `k`. Multiply the result by 100 and take the floor to get the result with two decimal places without rounding.
5. Print the time required to fill the tank.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of hoses. This is because we need to read the amount of water provided by each hose once.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the capacity of the tank, the number of hoses, and the total amount of water provided by all hoses per minute.

# Implementation Details
The tricky part of the implementation is to get the result with two decimal places without rounding. To achieve this, we multiply the result by 100 and take the floor before dividing it by 100.

# Solution Code
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define ff first
#define ss second
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

double c, n, k;

int main(){
    // Set precision to 2 decimal places without rounding
    cout << setprecision(2) << fixed;
    
    // Read the capacity of the tank and the number of hoses
    cin >> c >> n;
    
    // Read the amount of water provided by each hose and add it to k
    for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
        double x;
        cin >> x;
        k += x;
    }
    
    // Calculate the time required to fill the tank
    double x = c/k;
    x *= 100;
    x = floor(x);
    x = x/100;
    
    // Print the time required to fill the tank
    cout << x << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
In this code, `c` is the capacity of the tank, `n` is the number of hoses, and `k` is the total amount of water provided by all hoses per minute. The variable `x` is used to store the time required to fill the tank.
