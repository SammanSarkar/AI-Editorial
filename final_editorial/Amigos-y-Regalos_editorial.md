# Problem Analysis

The problem is asking us to find the smallest number `V` such that we can give `C1` unique integers to the first friend and `C2` unique integers to the second friend, with the condition that none of the integers given to the first friend are divisible by `X` and none of the integers given to the second friend are divisible by `Y`. The integers we can give are from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., V}.

# Key Insights

The main insight needed to solve this problem is to realize that we can use binary search to find the smallest `V` that satisfies the conditions. We can start with the range [C1+C2, 6*(C1+C2)] and narrow it down until we find the smallest `V`.

# Algorithm/Approach

1. Read the inputs `C1`, `C2`, `X`, and `Y`.
2. Perform a binary search in the range [C1+C2, 6*(C1+C2)].
3. For each number `n` in the range, check if it satisfies the conditions:
   - Calculate `res1` as `n - n/X`. This represents the number of integers not divisible by `X` in the range [1, n].
   - Calculate `res2` as `n - n/X - n/Y + n/(X*Y)`. This represents the number of integers not divisible by `X` or `Y` in the range [1, n].
   - Calculate `res3` as `n - n/Y`. This represents the number of integers not divisible by `Y` in the range [1, n].
   - If `res3` is less than `C2`, subtract `C2 - res3` from `res2`.
   - If `res2` is less than 0, `n` does not satisfy the conditions.
   - If `res1` is less than `C1`, subtract `C1 - res1` from `res2`.
   - If `res2` is less than 0, `n` does not satisfy the conditions.
4. If `n` satisfies the conditions, update the upper bound of the binary search range. Otherwise, update the lower bound.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the binary search range is narrowed down to a single number.
6. Print the smallest `V` that satisfies the conditions.

# Time & Space Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(logN) due to the binary search, where N is the sum of `C1` and `C2`. The space complexity is O(1) as we only need a constant amount of space to store the inputs and intermediate results.

# Implementation Details

The tricky part of the implementation is the calculation of `res1`, `res2`, and `res3` and the checks to see if `n` satisfies the conditions. We need to carefully handle the cases where `res3` is less than `C2` and `res1` is less than `C1` to ensure that we don't give away more integers than we have.

# Solution Code

```c11-gcc
#include <stdio.h>

long long int c1,c2,p,q,mitad,res1,res2,res3;

void entrada(){
	scanf("%lld" "%lld" "%lld" "%lld",&c1,&c2,&p,&q);
}

int comprobar(long long int n){
    res1=n-(n/p);
    res2=n-(n/p)-(n/q)+(n/(p*q));
    res3=n-(n/q);
    res3-=res2;
    res1-=res2;
    if(res3<c2)
		res2-=c2-res3;
    if(res2<0)
		return 0;
    if(res1<c1)
		res2-=c1-res1;
    if(res2<0)
		return 0;
    return  1;
}

long long int bs(long long int ini, long long int fin){
    mitad=(ini+fin)/2;
    if(ini==fin)
		return ini;
    if(comprobar(mitad))
		return bs(ini,mitad);
    else 
		return bs(mitad+1,fin);
}

int main(){
    entrada();
    printf("%lld\n", bs(c1+c2, 6LL*(c1+c2)));
    return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the inputs. Then it performs a binary search in the range [C1+C2, 6*(C1+C2)]. For each number in the range, it checks if it satisfies the conditions by calculating `res1`, `res2`, and `res3` and performing the necessary checks. If the number satisfies the conditions, it updates the upper bound of the binary search range. Otherwise, it updates the lower bound. Finally, it prints the smallest `V` that satisfies the conditions.
