# Problem Analysis
The problem is a simulation of a voting process in the popular game "Among Us". The crew members of a spaceship are trying to find an imposter among them. Each crew member is represented by a unique number and they vote by indicating the number of another crew member. The crew member with the most votes is declared the imposter and is expelled from the spaceship. If there is a tie for the most votes, no one is expelled. The task is to simulate this voting process and output the number of the crew member who is expelled, or a message indicating that no one was expelled in the case of a tie.

# Key Insights
The main insight to solve this problem is to realize that we can use an array to count the votes for each crew member. The index of the array can represent the crew member's number and the value at that index can represent the number of votes that crew member has received. This way, we can easily keep track of the votes and find the crew member with the most votes.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the number of crew members, N.
2. Initialize an array of size N+1 to count the votes. We use N+1 because the crew members are numbered from 1 to N.
3. For each crew member, read their vote and increment the corresponding count in the array.
4. Iterate over the array to find the crew member with the most votes. Keep track of the maximum number of votes and the crew member who received them. If there is a tie for the most votes, set a flag to indicate this.
5. If there was a tie, output "Nadie fue expulsado". Otherwise, output the number of the crew member who was expelled.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(N) because we perform a single pass over the array of votes. The space complexity is also O(N) because we use an array of size N+1 to count the votes.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward once we understand the approach. The only tricky part might be handling the tie case. We use a boolean flag to indicate whether there was a tie. If we find a crew member with more votes than the current maximum, we update the maximum and the crew member, and reset the flag. If we find a crew member with the same number of votes as the current maximum, we set the flag.

# Solution Code
```cpp11-gcc
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    
    vector<int> votes(N+1);
    
    // Read the votes and update the counts
    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++){
        int vote;
        cin >> vote;
        votes[vote]++;
    }
    
    // Find the crew member with the most votes
    int max_votes = votes[1];
    int imposter = 1;
    bool tie = false;
    for (int i=2; i<=N; i++){
        if (votes[i] > max_votes){
            max_votes = votes[i];
            imposter = i;
            tie = false;
        }
        else if (votes[i] == max_votes){
            tie = true;
        }
    }
    
    // Output the result
    if (tie) 
        cout << "Nadie fue expulsado" << endl;
    else
        cout << "#" << imposter << " fue expulsado" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
This code reads the number of crew members and their votes, counts the votes, finds the crew member with the most votes, and outputs the result. The use of a vector to count the votes makes the implementation simple and efficient.
