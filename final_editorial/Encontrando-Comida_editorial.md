# Problem Analysis
The problem is about cows on a farm that are trying to get back to the barn after a long day. Each cow is located in a different pasture and they all want to reach the barn located at pasture N. The cows can move from one pasture to another through a set of undirected paths. Each path connects two pastures and takes a certain amount of time to traverse. 

Some of the pastures contain hay bales that the cows can eat. Each hay bale provides a certain amount of satisfaction. A cow is willing to stop at a hay bale if the time it adds to her journey is at most the satisfaction provided by the hay bale. However, each cow will only stop at one hay bale. 

The problem asks us to determine for each cow, whether it is possible for her to stop at a hay bale on her way to the barn.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that it can be modeled as a shortest path problem on a graph. The pastures are the vertices of the graph, the paths between the pastures are the edges, and the time it takes to traverse each path is the weight of the edge. 

We can solve the problem by first finding the shortest path from each pasture to the barn. Then, for each hay bale, we check if the time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture containing the hay bale plus the satisfaction provided by the hay bale is less than or equal to the shortest time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture where the cow is located. If it is, then the cow can stop at the hay bale.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the input and construct the graph.
2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from each pasture to the barn. Store the shortest path distances in a map.
3. For each hay bale, calculate the time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture containing the hay bale plus the satisfaction provided by the hay bale. If this time is less than or equal to the shortest time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture where the cow is located, then the cow can stop at the hay bale. Store this information in a map.
4. Iterate over the pastures and print 1 if the cow in the pasture can stop at a hay bale, and 0 otherwise.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O((V+E)logV), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. In this problem, V is the number of pastures (N) and E is the number of paths (M). Therefore, the time complexity of the solution is O((N+M)logN).

The space complexity of the solution is O(N+M), which is the space needed to store the graph, the shortest path distances, and the information about the hay bales.

# Implementation Details
The implementation uses the STL set to implement the priority queue needed by Dijkstra's algorithm. The set is used to store the vertices ordered by their shortest path distances. The map is used to store the shortest path distances and the information about the hay bales.

In the implementation, the barn is added as an extra vertex to the graph. This is done to simplify the calculation of the time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture containing a hay bale. The weight of the edge connecting the barn and the pasture containing a hay bale is set to the difference between the shortest time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture and the satisfaction provided by the hay bale.

using namespace std;

// Function to find the shortest path from each pasture to the barn

  while (!visited.empty()) {
    int i = visited.begin()->second;
    visited.erase(visited.begin());
    for (auto j : nbrs[i])
      if (dist.count(j) == 0 || dist[i] + edgewt[make_pair(i,j)] < dist[j]) {
	dist[j] = dist[i] + edgewt[make_pair(i,j)];
	visited.insert(make_pair(dist[j],j));
      }
  }
}

int main(void)

  int N, M, K;

    int a, b, t;
    cin >> a >> b >> t;
    a--; b--;
    nbrs[a].push_back(b);
    nbrs[b].push_back(a);
    edgewt[make_pair(a,b)] = t;
    edgewt[make_pair(b,a)] = t;
  }
  for (int i=0; i<K; i++) {
    cin >> H[i] >> Y[i];
    H[i]--;
  }

  map<int,int> dist;
  dijkstra(N-1, nbrs, edgewt, dist);
  map<int,int> orig_dist = dist;
  for (int i=0; i<K; i++) {
    nbrs[N].push_back(H[i]);
    edgewt[make_pair(N,H[i])] = orig_dist[H[i]] - Y[i];
  }
  dist.clear();
  dijkstra(N, nbrs, edgewt, dist);
  for (int i=0; i<N-1; i++) 
    cout << (dist[i] <= orig_dist[i]) << "\n";

  return 0;
}

This solution first reads the input and constructs the graph. It then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from each pasture to the barn. For each hay bale, it checks if the time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture containing the hay bale plus the satisfaction provided by the hay bale is less than or equal to the shortest time it takes to reach the barn from the pasture where the cow is located. If it is, then the cow can stop at the hay bale. Finally, it iterates over the pastures and prints 1 if the cow in the pasture can stop at a hay bale, and 0 otherwise.
