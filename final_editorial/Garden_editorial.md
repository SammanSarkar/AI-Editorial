# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking to find two disjoint rectangular areas in a garden, each containing exactly k roses, such that the sum of the perimeters of these two rectangles is minimum. If no such pair of rectangles exist, we should output "NO".

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that we can solve it using dynamic programming and prefix sums. We can precalculate the number of roses in all possible rectangles and then use this information to find the two rectangles with the minimum sum of perimeters.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. First, we read the dimensions of the garden, the number of roses, and the number of roses that should be in each of the rectangular areas.
2. Then, we read the positions of the roses and store them in a 2D array.
3. We calculate prefix sums for each row and each column of the garden. This will allow us to quickly calculate the number of roses in any rectangle.
4. For each possible pair of columns (i, j), we find the minimum perimeter rectangle that contains exactly k roses and lies between these two columns. We store this information in a 2D array `precalculo`.
5. We repeat the same process for each possible pair of rows.
6. Finally, we iterate over all possible pairs of rectangles and find the pair with the minimum sum of perimeters.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N^4), where N is the maximum dimension of the garden. This is because we have two nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs of columns (or rows), and inside these loops, we have another loop to find the minimum perimeter rectangle.

The space complexity is O(N^2), which is needed to store the garden and the `precalculo` array.

# Implementation Details
The tricky part of the implementation is to correctly calculate the prefix sums and use them to find the number of roses in any rectangle. We need to be careful with the indices and make sure we don't go out of bounds.

Another tricky part is to find the minimum perimeter rectangle that contains exactly k roses. We use a sliding window approach for this. We start with a window of size 1 and keep expanding it until we have at least k roses in the window. If we have more than k roses, we start shrinking the window from the left.

# Solution Code
Here is a well-commented version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>
#define MAXN 255
#define INF (1<<30)

using namespace std;

int garden[MAXN][MAXN];
int N, M, F, K;
int a, b;
int answer = INF;
int precalculo[MAXN][MAXN];

int main() {
    // Read the dimensions of the garden, the number of roses, and the number of roses that should be in each of the rectangular areas
    scanf("%d%d%d%d", &N, &M, &F, &K);
    for (int i = 1; i <= F; i++) {
        // Read the positions of the roses
        scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
        garden[a][b]++;
    }

    // Calculate prefix sums for each row
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
        for (int j = 1; j <= M; j++)
            garden[i][j] += garden[i][j - 1];

    // For each possible pair of columns, find the minimum perimeter rectangle that contains exactly k roses
    for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j <= M; j++) {
            precalculo[i][j] = INF;
            int start = 1, end = 1;
            int sum = garden[1][j] - garden[1][i - 1];
            while (end <= N) {
                if (sum == K)
                    precalculo[i][j] = min(precalculo[i][j], (j - i + 1) * 2 + (end - start + 1) * 2);
                if (sum >= K) {
                    sum -= garden[start][j] - garden[start][i - 1];
                    start++;
                } else {
                    end++;
                    sum += garden[end][j] - garden[end][i - 1];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Iterate over all possible pairs of rectangles and find the pair with the minimum sum of perimeters
    for (int i = 1; i < M; i++) {
        int min1 = INF;
        int min2 = INF;
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            for (int k = j; k <= i; k++) {
                min1 = min(min1, precalculo[j][k]);
            }
        }
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= M; j++) {
            for (int k = j; k <= M; k++) {
                min2 = min(min2, precalculo[j][k]);
            }
        }
        answer = min(answer, min1 + min2);
    }

    // Print the answer
    if (answer >= INF) printf("NO\n");
    else printf("%d\n", answer);

    return 0;
}
```
This solution first calculates the prefix sums for each row and then uses this information to find the minimum perimeter rectangle that contains exactly k roses for each possible pair of columns. It then iterates over all possible pairs of rectangles and finds the pair with the minimum sum of perimeters. The answer is either the minimum sum of perimeters or "NO" if no such pair of rectangles exist.
