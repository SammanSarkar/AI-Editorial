# Problem Analysis
The problem presents a toy called "Minijus" that consists of `N` boxes, each containing an integer. A doll starts from box `1` and can jump up to `a_i` boxes from the current box `i`. The goal is to find the minimum number of jumps the doll needs to reach the box `N`. If the doll cannot reach box `N`, we should return `-1`.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that we can use a greedy approach. At each step, we should make the doll jump as far as possible. This way, we can ensure that the doll reaches the end with the minimum number of jumps.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Initialize `i` to `1` and `limSalto` to `1 + Casilla[i]`. `limSalto` is the farthest box the doll can reach in the current jump. Also, initialize `Cont` to `0` which will keep track of the number of jumps.
2. While `i` is less than `N`, do the following:
   1. Initialize `Avanza` to `i` and `nuevoLimite` to `0`. `Avanza` is the box where the doll will land after the current jump and `nuevoLimite` is the farthest box the doll can reach in the next jump.
   2. While `Avanza` is less than or equal to `N` and `Avanza` is less than or equal to `limSalto`, do the following:
      1. Update `nuevoLimite` to be the maximum of `nuevoLimite` and `Avanza + Casilla[Avanza]`.
      2. Increment `Avanza` by `1`.
   3. Decrement `Avanza` by `1`.
   4. If `Avanza` is equal to `i`, print `-1` and return because the doll cannot reach the end.
   5. Update `limSalto` to `nuevoLimite` and `i` to `Avanza`.
   6. Increment `Cont` by `1`.
3. Print `Cont`.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(N) because we are iterating over the boxes once. The space complexity is also O(N) because we are storing the number of boxes the doll can jump from each box.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward once we understand the algorithm. The only tricky part is to ensure that we update `Avanza` and `limSalto` correctly. We should decrement `Avanza` by `1` after the inner while loop because we have incremented `Avanza` by `1` one more time than necessary. We should also update `limSalto` to `nuevoLimite` and not `Avanza + Casilla[Avanza]` because `nuevoLimite` is the farthest box the doll can reach in the next jump.

# Solution Code
```cpp20-clang
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int Maxn=1e7+1;
int Casilla[Maxn];

int main(){
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);

    int N,i;
    cin>>N;

    for(i=1;i<=N;i++) cin>>Casilla[i];

    int Cont=0,limSalto,nuevoLimite;
    int Avanza;
    i=1;
    limSalto=1+Casilla[i];

    while(i<N){
        Avanza = i;
        nuevoLimite=0;

        while(Avanza<=N && Avanza<=limSalto){
            nuevoLimite = max(nuevoLimite,Avanza+Casilla[Avanza]);
            Avanza+=1;
        }

        Avanza-=1;

        if(Avanza==i){
            cout<<-1;
            return 0;
        }

        limSalto = nuevoLimite;
        Cont+=1;
        i = Avanza;
    }

    cout<<Cont;
}
```
This code first reads the number of boxes and the number of boxes the doll can jump from each box. It then follows the algorithm described above to find the minimum number of jumps the doll needs to reach the end. If the doll cannot reach the end, it prints `-1`.
