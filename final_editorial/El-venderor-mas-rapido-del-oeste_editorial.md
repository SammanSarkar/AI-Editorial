## Problem Analysis

The problem is asking us to calculate the commission that Pepito will earn based on his total monthly sales. The commission rate is 2% of the total sales. The input is a decimal number representing the total sales, and the output is another decimal number representing the commission.

## Key Insights

The key insight to solve this problem is understanding that the commission is calculated as a percentage of the total sales. In this case, the commission is 2% of the total sales. Therefore, to calculate the commission, we simply need to multiply the total sales by 0.02.

## Algorithm/Approach

1. Read the total sales from the input.
2. Multiply the total sales by 0.02 to calculate the commission.
3. Print the commission.

## Time & Space Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(1) because we only perform a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input.

The space complexity is also O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the total sales and the commission.

## Implementation Details

The solution is straightforward and does not have any tricky implementation details. However, it's important to note that we use the `fixed` and `setprecision(0)` manipulators to format the output. The `fixed` manipulator ensures that the output is displayed in fixed-point notation, and `setprecision(0)` sets the number of digits displayed after the decimal point to 0.

## Solution Code

Here is a well-commented, clean, and readable version of the solution:

```cpp17-gcc
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Speed up input/output operations
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);

    // Read the total sales
    double totalSales;
    cin >> totalSales;

    // Calculate the commission
    double commission = totalSales * 0.02;

    // Print the commission in fixed-point notation with 0 digits after the decimal point
    cout << fixed << setprecision(0) << commission;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads the total sales, calculates the commission, and then prints the commission. It uses the `fixed` and `setprecision(0)` manipulators to format the output as required by the problem statement.
