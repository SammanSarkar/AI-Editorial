# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to calculate the area of a figure formed by following a set of instructions. The figure is formed by placing sticks in four directions (up, down, left, right) starting from an initial point. Each stick is of one centimeter in length. The figure formed is always closed and never crosses itself. The instructions are given in the form of a string where 'R' represents up, 'B' represents down, 'I' represents left and 'D' represents right. Our task is to calculate the area of the figure in square centimeters.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is understanding how the area of a figure can be calculated by following the instructions. The area can be calculated by tracking the height of the figure as we traverse through the instructions. When we move up or down, the height changes. When we move right, we add the current height to the area. When we move left, we subtract the current height from the area.

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Initialize the area and height to 0.
2. Traverse through each character in the instruction string.
3. If the character is 'R', increment the height.
4. If the character is 'B', decrement the height.
5. If the character is 'D', add the current height to the area.
6. If the character is 'I', subtract the current height from the area.
7. After traversing through all the characters, if the area is negative, multiply it by -1 to make it positive.
8. Print the area.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the length of the instruction string. This is because we are traversing through each character in the string once.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space to store the area and height.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward once we understand the approach. We just need to be careful when dealing with the negative area. If the area is negative after traversing through all the instructions, we need to multiply it by -1 to make it positive.

# Solution Code
```cpp11
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    string instructions;
    cin>>instructions;
    
    int area = 0, height = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        if (instructions[i]=='R'){
            height++;
        }
        else if(instructions[i]=='B'){
            height--;
        }
        else if(instructions[i]=='D'){
            area+=height;
        }
        else if (instructions[i]=='I'){
            area-=height;
        }
    }
    
    if(area<0){
        area *= -1;
    }
    
    cout<<area;
    return 0;
}
```
This code first reads the number of instructions and the instructions string. It then initializes the area and height to 0. It traverses through each character in the instructions string and updates the area and height based on the character. Finally, it checks if the area is negative and if so, it multiplies it by -1 to make it positive. It then prints the area.
