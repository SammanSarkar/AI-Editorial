# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking us to find the minimum amount of money that the students will owe after buying products from the store. The students have a certain amount of money and there are various products with different prices. The students will always owe some money, so we need to find a way for them to owe the least amount possible.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to understand that this is a variation of the subset sum problem, where we are trying to find a subset of the product prices that sum up to as close as possible to the money the students have, without exceeding it. 

# Algorithm/Approach
1. Read the number of products and the money the students have.
2. Read the prices of the products.
3. Use a recursive function to generate all possible subsets of the product prices. For each subset, calculate the sum of its elements.
4. If the sum of a subset is less than or equal to the money the students have, then generate more subsets by including the next elements. If the sum exceeds the money the students have, then calculate the difference between the sum and the money the students have. If this difference is less than the current minimum difference, update the minimum difference.
5. After generating all subsets, the minimum difference is the minimum amount of money the students will owe.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(2^n), where n is the number of products. This is because in the worst case, we are generating all possible subsets of the product prices, which is 2^n subsets. 

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of products. This is because we are using an array to store the product prices and a recursive function which will at most have n recursive calls on the call stack.

# Implementation Details
The tricky part in the implementation is the recursive function that generates all possible subsets of the product prices. We need to keep track of the current sum of the subset and the position of the next element to be included in the subset. We also need to make sure to backtrack by subtracting the current element from the sum before returning from the function.

# Solution Code
```cpp11
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int n, prices[101], min_debt = 100000000, money;

void find_min_debt(int sum, int pos)
{
    if(sum > money) return;
    for(int i = pos; i <= n; i++)
    {
        sum += prices[i];
        if(sum <= money)
        {
            find_min_debt(sum, i + 1);
        }
        else
        {
            if(sum - money < min_debt)
                min_debt = sum - money;
        }
        sum -= prices[i]; // backtrack
    }
}

int main()
{
    cin >> n >> money;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        cin >> prices[i];
    }
    find_min_debt(0, 1);
    cout << min_debt;
    return 0;
}
```
In the code above, `find_min_debt` is the recursive function that generates all possible subsets of the product prices. It takes the current sum of the subset and the position of the next element to be included in the subset as parameters. The `min_debt` variable stores the minimum amount of money the students will owe.
