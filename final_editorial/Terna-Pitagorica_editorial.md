# Problem Analysis
The problem is asking for a Pythagorean triplet (a set of three natural numbers a, b, c) where a < b < c and a^2 + b^2 = c^2. The sum of these three numbers should be equal to 1000. We need to find the product of these three numbers.

# Key Insights
The key insight to solve this problem is to understand the properties of Pythagorean triplets. 

1. All three numbers are natural numbers.
2. The square of the largest number is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two numbers.

# Algorithm/Approach
We can solve this problem using a brute force approach. 

1. Iterate over a and b where a < b < c and a + b + c = 1000.
2. For each pair of a and b, calculate c = 1000 - a - b.
3. Check if a^2 + b^2 = c^2. If it does, then a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet and we have found our solution.

# Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we are iterating over a and b in a nested loop. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store our variables a, b, and c.

# Implementation Details
The implementation is straightforward once we understand the properties of Pythagorean triplets. We just need to be careful with our loop conditions to ensure that a < b < c and a + b + c = 1000.

# Solution Code
Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
# Iterate over possible values of a and b
for a in range(1, 1000):
    for b in range(a, 1000):
        # Calculate c
        c = 1000 - a - b
        # Check if a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet
        if a*a + b*b == c*c:
            # If they do, print the product of a, b, and c
            print(a*b*c)
            break
```

This code iterates over all possible values of a and b. For each pair of a and b, it calculates c and checks if a, b, and c form a Pythagorean triplet. If they do, it prints the product of a, b, and c and breaks out of the loop.
