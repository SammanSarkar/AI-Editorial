python quality_problems_finder.py 25
python quality_problems_finder.py 100

# Usage help
python quality_problems_finder.py --help
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Uses production `/api/problem/list` endpoint with `only_quality_seal=true` 
- ✅ Fetches all quality problems with pagination support
- ✅ Randomly selects specified number of problems
- ✅ Saves problem aliases to text file for batch processing
- ✅ Detailed logging of selection process
- ✅ Handles large datasets efficiently (up to 10,000+ problems)

**Output:**
- Creates `quality_problems_[count].txt` with selected problem aliases
- One problem alias per line for easy batch processing
- Compatible with `prod_demo.py --file` and `ac_tester.py` for bulk processing

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

### For AI Success Rate Analysis:
